## graphify (code knowledge graph)

`graphify-out/graph.json` maps this repo (tree-sitter AST; rebuilt by the git post-commit hook; gitignored).

- For orientation ("where is X handled", "what connects A to B", "explain module M"), prefer `graphify query "<question>"` / `graphify explain "<Module>"` / `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` over grep/Read fan-outs — one call returns a scoped subgraph with file:line hits.
- Graph output is NAVIGATION, never evidence. Edges reflect the last build, not the working tree, and cross-module call edges can be incomplete (Elixir: file-local only — alias-mediated calls are NOT resolved). Consumer sweeps and every load-bearing claim (review finding, plan anchor) still verify against live code: grep + file:line read.
- After large uncommitted changes, `graphify update .` refreshes the graph (AST-only, no API cost, no key).
